Development
-----------

Currently an EC2 instance of the docker containers at: http://pay.dev.mozaws.net.
Will probably be replaced by a Mozilla ops supported at some point soon.

When you visit, you are shown the example site (Mozilla Concrete),
click on either Mortar or Brick to purchase. Please note this will take you to
the stable version of Firefox Accounts (not the production one).

For the management interface go to: http://pay.dev.mozaws.net:8000/management.html and
again this connects to the stable version of Firefox Accounts.

Please note all data is temporary and liable to be deleted. The server is not
guaranteed to be up.
